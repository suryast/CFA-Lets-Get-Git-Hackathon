## Project Brief
This project was created to give solution of the internal hackathon event that was conducted at Coders Factory – theme for the hackathon was education. Out solution was to create a training-wheel platform for open-source collaboration. Although we only had 72 hours to build – our team managed to deliver fully functional platform with both functional backend APIs, frontend styling and user dashboard.

My role in this project is to design and curate all the frontend aspects and all the pages after all the backend APIs had been created. I also tested the backend APIs for any functional bugs.

## Problem

* It can be daunting to start collaborating on a projects for people new to programming.
* Now, it feel you need more than 10+ years of experience before starting or joining an opensource project.
* Many beginners get frustrated and giving up before even trying.
